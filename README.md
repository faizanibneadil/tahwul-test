🛠 How I Built the Project
As a Full Stack Developer, I built this application with a focus on responsiveness, type safety, and modern CSS-first workflows.

Next.js 15: Leveraged the latest App Router and Server Components for optimized performance and SEO.

Tailwind CSS v4: Implemented the new CSS-first engine, which eliminates legacy configuration files and provides a faster, more streamlined styling experience.

Recharts: Developed custom data visualizations, including a tailored Radial Bar Chart for the "Audit Readiness" gauge with manual SVG path adjustments.

TypeScript: Utilized throughout the project to ensure strict type safety and a better developer experience.

Shadcn/UI: Used as a foundation for UI components, heavily customized to meet the professional aesthetic of strategic planning dashboards.

🧠 Assumptions Made
UI Layout: Assumed a grid-based 1:3 ratio for strategic cards to maintain a clean balance between labels and content.

Responsive Breakpoints: Assumed standard breakpoints for mobile and desktop to ensure the layout transitions smoothly from a single column to a side-by-side view.

Visual Standards: Followed a specific professional color palette (Navy Blue & Green) based on common government and corporate strategic portal designs.

📈 Future Improvements (With More Time)
If I had more time, I would focus on:

Full Backend Integration: Connecting the Prisma/Sequelize ORM to enable real-time data persistence and dynamic dashboard updates.

Advanced Interactivity: Adding Framer Motion for smoother entrance animations and interactive hover states on charts.

Export Features: Implementing a tool to export the strategic summary as a professional PDF report.

Comprehensive Testing: Adding unit and E2E tests using Jest and Cypress to ensure reliability in audit calculations.
